*** Register data 

Every citizen in Denmark has a person identification number.
\vfill

The national records include:
\vfill
- birth date, immigration/emigration dates, date of death
- type (ATC) and redemption dates of medical prescriptions
- dates and reasons (ICD) for hospital admission
- blood tests, surgery ...
- education, income, household ...

*** To be avoided: immortal time bias

  [[~/research/Talks/Dortmund/worg/immortal-time-bias.jpg]]

*** A wrong conclusion which could have been avoided

``Prescription trajectories can provide novel insights into how
individuals’ drug use change over time, identify suboptimal or futile prescriptions and suggest initial treatments different from ﬁrst
line therapies. Observations of this kind may also be important when updating treatment guidelines.''[fn:2]

\vfill\pause
No question was asked! 
\vfill
The result was obtained by data mining!?

*** The Cox regression model with time-dependent covariates 

# - Latent outcome event time: \(T^{(1)}\)
# - Latent time of death without outcome: \(T^{(2)}\)
# - Observe \(\min(T^{(1)},T^{(2)},C)\)
  
\vfill
The outcome-specific hazard rate at time \(t\) depends on the treatment and covariate history:
\vfill
#+begin_export latex
\mybox{
\begin{equation*}
\lambda(t|\bar A(t),\bar L(t))=\lambda_0(t)\exp\{\beta \bar A(t)+\gamma \bar L(t)\}
\end{equation*}
}
#+end_export
\vfill
The hazard ratio \(e^\beta\) can be estimated via maximum partial likelihood, Poisson regression or conditional logistic regression (nested case control design).
# \vfill
# \pause
# This model cannot provide guidance on the treatment decision unless someone defines the time point where the treatment is decided.

\pause

*** Another example: using Robin's g-methods

Cardiovascular effect of discontinuing statins for primary prevention
at the age of 75 years: a nationwide population-based cohort study in
France [fn:4]

- Aims :: The effect of statin discontinuation on cardiovascular outcomes
- Enrollment :: All statin users who turned 75 in 2012-2014 
- Methods? :: The hazard ratio comparing statin discontinuation with continuation was estimated using a *marginal structural model* adjusting for both baseline and time-varying covariates
- Results?? :: Statin discontinuation was associated with a 33% (HR: 1.33) increased risk of admission for cardiovascular event in 75-year-old primary prevention patients.

*** Adjusted cumulative incidence: Igitt? 

  [[~/research/Talks/Dortmund/worg/Screenshot_2024-09-07_09-26-25.jpg]]

*** The french study is half-baked

The authors define a proper framework for survival analysis:
 - population
 - time zero
 - time to cardiovascular outcome
\vfill
The authors use a marginal structural model and inverse probability weighting to deal with time-varying
confounding. \vfill
\hrule
\vfill
But:

- What is the interpretation of the adjusted cumulative incidence curve and the adjusted hazard ratio?
- When is the time of statins discontinuation?
- What about the competing risk of death due to other causes?

*** Avoidable flaws in observational analyses[fn:3]

The increasing availability of large healthcare databases is fueling
an intense debate on whether real-world data should play a role in the
assessment of the benefit-risk of medical treatments.
\vfill 

In many observational studies, for example, statin users were found to
have a substantially lower risk of cancer than in meta-analyses of
randomized trials. While such discrepancies are often attributed to a
lack of randomization in the observational studies, they may be
explained by flaws that can be avoided by

*** Emulating a target trial in register data[fn:1]

- Step 1 :: enrollment date (time zero for survival analysis, inclusion/exclusion)
\vfill
- Step 2 :: the target trial protocols dictate the treatment at any time during followup
\vfill
- Step 3 :: define the target parameters as contrasts of the expected outcomes -- had *all subjects* \sout{been randomized}{ adhered} to the protocols
\vfill
- Step 4 :: estimation of target parameters
\vfill
- Step 5 :: communication of results and limitations

*** Emulating trials in register data

In register studies there is often no natural control group
of patients who are not exposed to one of the drugs.

- Matching can be used (e.g., exposure density sampling).
- A medical diagnosis (biomarker above threshold) can be used.
- Comparative effectiveness study: active comparator arms.
\vfill\pause\hrule\vfill

Example: We include all diabetes patients in Denmark who initiated medical treatment
with one of the following anti-diabetic drugs: GLP1-RA, SGLT2i between 2015
and 2022:
\vfill

- Time zero is at (or 30 days after) the first purchase of the drug
- We follow the patients through the registers until comorbidity, death, emigration, or 2024, whatever comes first.

*** Treatment assignment in the target trial

The protocols of the target trial dictate the treatment(s) given at
any time (doctor visit) during the target trial period.\vfill

Notation:
#+begin_export latex

| Treat if \(L(t-)>\xi\)                      | Dynamic              | \(1{\{L(t-)>\xi\}}\)         |
| Treat with probability  0.8                 | Stochastic           | 0.8                          |
| If \(L(t-)>\xi\) treat with probability 0.8 | Stochastic, Dynamic  | \(1{\{L(t-)>\xi\}}0.8\)      |

*** Treatment assignment in the target trial

Example of treatment regimens:
\vfill
- Protocol 1 :: Patients should use GLP1-RA continuously for 3 years and not intensify with SGLT2i
- Protocol 2 :: Patients should use SGLT2i continuously for 3 years and not intensify with GLP1-RA
\vfill Protocol 1 assigns 100% probability for GLP1-RA and 0%
probability for SGLT2i:
#+begin_export latex
\begin{align*}
\pi^{1*}(t) &= (1,0). \intertext{Protocol 2 is defined similarly:}
\pi^{2*}(t) &= (0,1)
\end{align*}
#+end_export

*** The target parameter (aka the estimand)

The analysis of the emulated target trial estimates the absolute risks of the
outcome(s) if hypothetically all patients had followed
the treatment protocols (per-protocol effects).  \vfill

Example: 3-year risk of cardiovascular disease under \(\pi^{j*}\) and
differences thereof:
#+begin_export latex
\begin{equation*}
\P_{\pi^{1*}}(Y(3) = 1)-\P_{\pi^{2*}}(Y(3) = 1)
\end{equation*}
#+end_export
  \vfill

The analyst uses the information of the
time-varying covariates (comorbidity, co-medicine) to achieve a good
compromise between:
- the available data
- the desire of the investigators
- the causal assumptions: /positivity/, /sequential coarsening at random (NUC)/, /consistency/.

A motivation for the roadmap of targeted learning is the
problem that the various nuisance parameter regression models could be
misspecified.  \vfill

The targeted minimum loss based estimator can be consistent even if
some of the nuisance parameter models are misspecified.  \vfill

For longitudinal data analysis, the sequential regression estimator is
moved closer to the unknown truth by sequential updating with

*** Statistical methods (statins discontinuation paper)

A weighted Cox proportional hazard model was used to estimate the
hazard ratio of statin discontinuation vs continuation, controlling
for baseline and time-varying confounding.

Weighting creates a pseudo-population, in which at each time the
probability of being treated is unrelated to \colorbox{black}{the measured and}
time-varying confounders. Also, compared conventional multivariate Cox
models, weighted Cox proportional hazard models are more flexible in
that they do not rely on the assumptions of proportional hazards and
no \colorbox{black}{effect  for each of the covariates.}In 
order to  \colorbox{black}{also correct for} potentially *informative*
*censoring at treatment resumption*, the patient’s initial weight was
multiplied by the inverse probability of remaining uncensored up until
month t, based on the patient's covariate history. The resulting
weights are called ``inverse probability of treatment and censoring
weights'' (IPTCW). Under the assumptions of no unmeasured confounding,
positivity, correct model specification, and consistency, this
approach estimates the parameter of a marginal structural model, which
can be interpreted as average causal effect of treatment
discontinuation in the original study population.

*** Certain potential biases (statins discontinuation paper)

With the study design adopted, time-related bias, in particular
immortal time bias, was avoided by \dots
\vfill
# i) defining the study population
# based on information on a fixed time period (up to month 2 following
# the month of the 75th birthday) and starting follow-up at a time-point
# after this fixed time period (month 3), and ii) using a time-dependent
# exposure variable whose value at month m is defined by information up
# until m-1 (Suissa 2008, Suissa et al. 2012).  Prevalent users may be a
# concern in studies including both prevalent and new users (Danaei et
# al. 2012). In the present study population, prevalent user bias per se
# was limited, as all patients were adherent to statin therapy during
# the two years before their 75th birthday.
\dots Potential bias due to
treating competing events as censoring events as in our analyses is
also small: in the main analysis, only 2.7% of patients were *censored for death* and, \dots
\vfill
\dots  The percentage of
competing events was therefore much lower than 10%, the critical value
reported in the literature (Austin et al., 2016).

  important for the clinical interpretation!)
- when outcome event \(Y_k\) and censoring \(C_k\) occur in same interval,
  then evidently outcome is not censored!

- \(^a\) Weights were truncated by resetting the value of the weights greater (less) than the p (1-p) percentile to the value of the p (1-p) percentile.
- \(^b\) No weight truncation.

*** From the statins discontinuation paper ...

This table illustrates the tradeoff between bias
and variance: with increasing weight truncation, confidence intervals
were shorter, but bias increased

\vfill
Assuming estimation without weight truncation is unbiased.
\vfill

In this case, it can be reasonably argued to
report the result with the weights truncated at the 0.5% and 99.5%
percentiles, on the basis of centering of the weights at a value of 1
and the reduction in the 1/minimum and maximum weights.

*** The gbounds issue

probabilities cannot become smaller than (by default)

**** The third analysis

Regard subjects as dependently censored at the minimum of *time to loss to follow-up, time to*
*treatment crossover, and time to voluntarily stopping therapy*
(for nonmedically related reasons).


For public health purposes, this analysis may be preferred since
it attempts to estimate the survival benefit *had no subject voluntarily*
*stopped* their assigned therapy without medical indication.

**** The fourth analysis

Regard subjects as censored at the minimum of
*time to loss to follow-up, crossover, or stopping therapy for any reason.*

In this analysis, we are attempting to compare the survival if all
subjects were *forced to stay* on their assigned therapy.

Even if we could successfully estimate this parameter, it would only
be of public health relevance if, as discussed above, the toxicities
that led to medically indicated termination of therapy could be
ameliorated with appropriate palliative therapy.

# Emulating target trials in longitudinal register data with time-to-event outcomes

In this talk I will discuss the longitudinal analysis of electronic
health records by emulating a target trial. Pharmacoepidemiology
studies the use and effects of drugs in a large population. Here
target trial emulation enables replication of results from a
randomized trial and beyond. For example, we can identify all diabetes
patients who started one of several alternative medical treatments in
the Danish registers. We could be interested in the cardiovascular
disease risk if hypothetically all patients had been assigned to using
one of the drugs continuously for 5 years. To compare longitudinal
treatment regimens we use a series of emulated trials which define
estimands as contrasts of the cardiovascular disease
risks. Longitudinal targeted minimum loss estimation projects the
observed data onto a discrete time grid, estimates sequences of
nuisance parameter models for treatment propensity and censoring
probabilities, and then estimates the target parameters by updating a
sequential regression formula backward in time. The estimation
procedure accounts for treatment changes, censoring and
non-cardiovascular mortality as a competing risk.
